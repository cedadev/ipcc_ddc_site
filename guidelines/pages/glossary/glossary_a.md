<a name="adaptation"></a>
<h3>Adaptation</h3><p>The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.  <b>WGIII</b></p>
<a name="adaptationCapacity"></a>
<h3>Adaptation Capacity</h3><p>The ability of systems, institutions, humans, and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences. <b>WGIII</b></p>
<a name="aerosols"></a>
<h3>Aerosol</h3><p>A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 micrometres that reside in the 
atmosphere for at least several hours. For convenience the term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspendig gas, is often used in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds.  <b>WGI</b></p>
<a name="albedo"></a>
<h3>Albedo</h3><p>The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often expressed as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a high albedo, the albedo of soils ranges from high to low, and vegetation-covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo. The Earth's planetary albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area and land cover changes. <b>WGI</b></p>

<a name="anthropogenic"></a>
<h3>Anthropogenic</h3><p>Resulting from or produced by human activities. <b>WGI</b></p>
<a name="ar4"></a>

<a name="atmosphere"></a>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3><p>The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium and addiatively active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and ozone. In addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse gas water vapour, whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio. the atmoshere also contains clouds and aerosols. <b>WGI</b></p>
